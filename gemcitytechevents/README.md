# Gem City Tech Events

Our 2014/15 Winter project aims to create a local tech event aggregator for the
Dayton area.

## Purpose
The motto of Dayton Clean Coders has always been _Exploring Patterns, Practices, and Tools for Sustainable Code_.
Gem City Tech Events is meant to be an opportunity to used these patterns, 
practices and tools in a non-pressured environment to build a reasonably sized application!

## Things to explore:
* Clean Architectures
* Build Automation
* Deployment Automation
* Editor Productivity
* Test Suite (Integration, Unit, Acceptance, UI)
* Data Stores (Relational, Document, Key/Value, Database as a Service)
